        <p class="intro">Anime, Youtube, Cartoons; I love them all. Here, I plan to not only explain, but show you some
            of my favorite
            of the weird stuff that makes my brain happy.</p>



        <section id="anime">

            <p>Although I don't watch it as often as I used to, I still love anime. Recently, I've even gotten my mom
                into watching anime. I prefer animation over live action shows in genreal because of how limitless the
                possibilites can be.</p>

        <section id="cartoon">
            <h2>Cartoons</h2>
            <img src="images/dgtlcrcs.jpg" alt="cover image of the indie animation The Amazing Digital Circus"
                class="round">
            <p>As I've already stated, I love animation. The difference between why I love anime and cartoons is that
                cartoons are just silly and goofy compared to anime having a continuous story. Not to say that cartoons
                don't follow a story, just that cartoons are (usually) much more lighthearted. </p>

        <section id="youtube">
            <h2>Other Media</h2>
            <img src="images/Hololive-Logo.png" alt="Logo of Cover Corp. Holoive" class="round">
            <p>When I'm not watching actual shows, I usually just have YouTube or a Twitch stream playing on my laptop.
                They're a really nice thing to listen to when you just need something in the background while you work.
                Tuning in and actually watching is only something I do every now and then, but when I do it never
                misses.</p>
