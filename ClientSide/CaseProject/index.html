        <p class="intro">When planning this, I couldn't really decide what I wanted to make it about. Most of my brain
            is constantly
            cluttered with thoughts about the things I hyperfixate on, and I spent way too long trying to come up with
            an idea. So, that's what I'm making this website about. A way for me to explain what and why I hyperfixate
            on with some interactivity. It's really just a safe, comfortable space for me to ramble about the things I
            love whether people see it or not.</p>
