        <p class="intro">Games, something I spend far to much time on. Even though I know I should play them less, I'm
            not going to.
            Instead, I'm going to feed my adiction by spewing the millions of unimportant information I have stored in
            my head and pouring it all into this website. Recently, an unfortunate increase in game prices has come to
            light, and apparently a decrease in game quality as well. I remember when you could buy a Wii game for $50.
            Now, even the worst games are a minimum of $70 at launch. Darn you inflation.</p>
