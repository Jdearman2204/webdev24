    <p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and release wildlife back
         into their natural environment. We are a nonprofit orginazation dedicated to helping injured 
         wildlife. Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We also provide 
         long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back into their natural environment. 
         Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care for our animals. 
         You can also donate, become a member, or become a sponsor. Contact us today.</p>
