            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>You need to use descriptive file names for image files so you can find the images easier.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used paint to resize the image.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The image was originally 2121x1414 pixels.</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 ong glass" height="333" width="500">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used compressor.io to compress the image file. The original file was 13KB, after using the compressor the sizwe was reduced to 8KB.</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>I don't see much of a difference other than the image quality being slightly worse after compressing it.</p>

                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I read the tutorial at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_inhtml.asp">w3schools</a>
                to help me understand how to create a SVG image.</p>
